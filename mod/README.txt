Autosaves are disabled by default due to extremely long saving times with many mods enabled. If you want
this mod to do more than warn you when you haven't saved in a while, you'll need to edit the config file.

Settings can be found in saves/common/config/lw_autosave_settings.json.data (this file is generated when
the game is first run with this mod enabled, so it won't exist on a fresh downloaded copy).
